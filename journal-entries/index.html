        <p>the more that i think about it, the world is such a scary place and the world wide web is no different. the manipulation and takeover of the web by large companies is no longer impending, but real and persistent. i thought the articles were provoking in that they highlighted the way artists can continue to change the meaning of websites through simply making their own. i enjoyed the idea of metaphors being used to address what a website can and cannot be, and how we interact with the creation and potential maintenance of it. </p>
