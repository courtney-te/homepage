        the more that i think about it, the world is such a scary place and the world wide web is no different. the manipulation and takeover of the web by large companies is no longer impending, but real and persistent. i thought the articles were provoking in that they highlighted the way artists can continue to change the meaning of websites through simply making their own. i enjoyed the idea of metaphors being used to address what a website can and cannot be, and how we interact with the creation and potential maintenance of it. </p></div>

                i recently had a conversation with my roommates about the juxtaposing nature of the internet. how it is a complex, weaving web of pages and convoluted links and algorithms, but at the same time, the daily user only experiences a fraction of what the world wide web has to offer. we often gravitate towards the same two to five websites that we forgot what it means to insert creativity into “handmade web” pages until i started this class. </p></div>

                I often think about the fact that websites are just a bunch of HTML files linked together. After reading this article, I’ve also realized that computers are essentially just a bunch of computations, even as simple as using your keyboard requires code and coding to function. It makes me think about what other things are essentially just made out of basic building blocks—cities, people, atoms… complexity is just built on repetitive simplicity.
